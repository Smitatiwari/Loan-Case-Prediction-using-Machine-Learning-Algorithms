# Loan-Case-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Following algorithms are used to predict loan case using the training set to build an accurate model and then the test set is used to report the accuracy of the model
K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression
The pre-processing, feature selection, and feature-extraction are done to make a better model. Scikit-learn, Scipy or Numpy libraries are used for developing the classification algorithms.
